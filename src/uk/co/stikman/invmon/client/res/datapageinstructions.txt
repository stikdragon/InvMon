Pass URL parameters to this page to set up the 
data range you're interested in:

example:

  http://host/InvMon/data?start=2023-03-01&duration=1d&fields=all&format=fixed
  
  
Here's the available options:

  start        [optional]
     The date to start from, in ISO8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD 
     or YYYY-MM-DDTHH-MM-SSZ)
     If not specified then the "duration" is considered negative
     and start date is now
     
  duration     [optional]
     The time span to work with.  This can be negative, in which 
     case it works back from the "start" parameter.  Specify it
     as an integer with a suffix:
       s,m,h,d,w  - seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks
     eg: "1d"  or "3600s"
     If not specified then it defaults to "1h"
     
  count        [optional]
     How many records to return.  Data is aggregated.  If not 
     provided then it won't do aggregation and will return the
     base records instead
     
  fields       [required]
     Which fields do you want?  Must be a comma separated list of 
     them, or the word "all" for everything.  Timestamp will 
     always be present
     
  format       [required]
     Which format to return the data in, either "fixed" or "csv"
     
     
Beware that there's no sanity checking here, you can ask for a 
huge number of records and it'll try to produce them, which might
make an impractically large file
