    <!--
    updatePeriod is the sample period

    allowConversion allows the database to be upgraded if you've switched to a new version
                    that has a different db structure.  it's worth setting this to `false` and
                    then taking a backup of the database in the event that it needs converting
                    (you'll get a startup error if it does and this isn't enabled)
    -->
    <Settings updatePeriod="1000" allowConversion="true" />
