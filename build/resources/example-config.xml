    updatePeriod - is the sample period

    allowConversion - allows the database to be upgraded if you've switched to a new version
                      that has a different db structure.  it's worth setting this to `false` and
                      then taking a backup of the database in the event that it needs converting
                      (you'll get a startup error if it does and this isn't enabled)

    model - names a file that defines the data model, you need to build this to match your 
            configuration
